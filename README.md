# taskListApp

I created this project to learn more about how JavaScript, html, and css can all work together cohesively. Before this, my web-development skills were really just static html pages with some css styling. However, I have learned the power that JavaScript holds and how it can dynamically change the html pages to make them more interactive. 

This project is a simple task list app that allows users to enter in tasks and cross them out when they are completed.
